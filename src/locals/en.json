  "kundli_matching_content3": "However, in recent times, the world has developed a very wrong perception about Kundali matching (matchmaking). Couples, especially those who dream of a love marriage, often see Kundali matching as a hurdle in their relationship. Many are afraid of the questions that may arise if their Kundalis don't match and thus try to skip the Gun Milan ritual. However, this perception is based on misinformation and half-baked knowledge forced into their minds. Honestly speaking, astrology is not a bone of contention in a relationship. In fact, if you consult an astrologer about your relationship, they will guide you with ways to strengthen it. Our astrologers, over the years, have encountered many instances where couples wanted to marry but their Kundalis did not match. In such cases, our astrologers provided understanding and support, offering the best advice on how couples can support each other after marriage to build a strong relationship despite mismatched Kundalis. They also suggested remedies to overcome compatibility issues. Today, many of these couples tell us how everything worked out well for them.",

  "kundli_content_2": "Creating an online Kundali for yourself is relatively easy—honestly, butter-easy. All you need to do to make your online Janam Kundali with ChatMyAstrologer is simply go to the ‘Kundali’ option and insert the requested information. The requested information would be your date of birth, time of birth, etc. The correct date and time allow precise predictions. Once you have filled in the details, all you need to do is click Submit. Within seconds, you will find a detailed Janam Kundali for yourself. Besides textual content (that will help you understand your strong or weak traits), the Janam Kundali will also help you with charts that showcase the position of the different planets in houses based on your current astrological situation, which reveals a whole new dimension of information. The free Janam Kundali you get on ChatMyAstrologer is made after a precise study of all the scientific methods, but when it comes to writing it down, the study is portrayed in very simple language so you can understand it without any hassle. However, just in case you hit a snag or can’t understand what it means, simply chat or ring our astrologers to help you with your queries. Besides getting a Janam Kundali for yourself, we also offer a Janam Kundali Matching service to anyone seeking it. Janam Kundali matching is most important when one plans to get married. Matching of Kundalis is done to ensure the girl and boy planning to get married are compatible with each other. This, however, doesn’t mean that if the Kundali doesn't match, one shouldn’t marry the other person. But in case the Kundali doesn't match, an astrologer can let you know why it didn’t and also recommend remedies. Janam Kundali matching is related to Gun matching. The Janam Kundalis of two people, when matched, show how many Guns match. Based on this, marriages are fixed. With Janam Kundali matching, you can also understand how being Manglik affects both individuals, what the effect of Manglik Dosha could be, and remedies to get rid of it. These are just a handful of situations where a Janam Kundali could come in handy. So if you're looking to get one for yourself, get in touch with our astrologers for the best advice and service. To get your online Janam Kundali, Kundali prediction, and Kundali reading, you can either chat with our astrologer or talk to our astrologer. For free online Kundali making, visit the Free Janam Kundali Chart option and get a personalized Janam Kundali using our software. You can also get a free Kundali check and free Kundali prediction.",
  
  "kundli_content_1": "The Kundali of a person is one of the most sought-after aspects of astrology. A Kundali entails the details about the positions of stars and planets at the time of your birth, based on which further predictions are made. And with further predictions, we mean insights into different aspects of one's life such as love, career, health, business, finance, and even marriage. Simply put, Kundali making is a necessary process for any individual and helps improve decision-making capabilities over time. A Janam Kundali is created by studying the exact position of planets at the time you were born, and based on that, one’s Sun sign, Moon sign, and other astrological details are listed. The Kundali is a combination of predictions and charts that help the astrologer understand what your future could look like—the times you will have to work harder and the times when luck will be on your side. However, with the cultural shift, people are becoming more tech-savvy and prefer to access things digitally. That’s why the Janam Kundali-making process has also moved online, making it more pocket-friendly, accessible, and detailed. At ChatMyAstrologer, for the convenience of our vast user base, we provide free Janam Kundalis online so that anyone and everyone has the opportunity to learn more about themselves and plan their life better. That said, some people wonder whether online Kundali astrology is accurate or if the traditional method by a Pandit or Vedic astrologer is better. To be honest, a Kundali made by a Vedic astrologer surely stands out (and our astrologers can do this for you), but online Kundali software is no less accurate. In fact, online Kundalis can be even more detailed. Just like a physical Kundali is created by learned Vedic astrologers, an online Kundali is also prepared according to astrological principles. The only difference is the medium—digital. The digitalization of Kundalis offers more benefits, such as multilingual support and ease of access.",

The daily Panchang is one of the most sought-after Vedic astrology concepts, which conceptualizes the day's planetary positions to determine auspicious tithis, timings, festivals, vrats, etc. Using this information, a person can decide whether or not to begin or accomplish a particular task after carefully studying the favorability or unfavorability of the planets ruling the task. It is a common belief that doing certain tasks according to today's Panchang timings brings good luck and helps in accomplishing them with ease.",

    "Panchang primarily consists of five key elements: the day of the week (Vaar), Tithi or the lunar day, Nakshatra or the constellation, Yoga, and Karan. With the change in time and date, all these elements also change. Thus, it is important to stay updated with them for various purposes."

    "There are a total of 30 Tithis in a lunar month. Each Tithi belongs either to the Shukla Paksha (bright half) or the Krishna Paksha (dark half). The beginning and end of a Tithi depend on the angular distance between the Moon and the Sun, and therefore, a Tithi can start or end at any time of the day.
