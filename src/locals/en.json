  "kundli_matching_content3": "However, the world, in recent times, has grown up to develop a very wrong perception about Kundali matching (match making). Couples, especially the ones who dream of a love marriage, find Kundali matching as a hurdle in their relationship. Many of them are scared of the questions that would arise if their kundalis don't match and thus find ways to skip the gun milan ritual. However, this perception of the couples about kundali matching is nothing but merely wrong facts aka half baked knowledge that have been forced into their minds. Honestly speaking, astrology never works as a bone of contention for your relationship. Instead, if you ever talk to an astrologer and ask them about your relationship, they will only introduce you to ways using which you can better your relationship. Our astrologers over the years have bumped into multiple instances where the couple really wanted to get married but their kundali was not matching. In such situations, our astrologers, being understanding enough, relied on sharing the best advice around how such couples shall support each other after marriage to harness a sound relationship even if their kundalis don’t match. Astrologers also shared with them the remedies that they can practice to make up for the lack of compatibility. And today these couples tell us how it has all worked fine for them.",

  "kundli_content_2": "Creating an online Kundali for yourself is relatively easy. Honestly, butter-easy. All you need to do to make your online Janam Kundali with ChatMyAstrologer is simply go to the ‘Kundali’ option and Insert the requested information. The requested information would be your date of birth, time of your birth, etc. The correct date and time allow precise predictions. Once you have filled in the details, all you need to do is click submit. Once you click submit, within seconds, you will find a detailed Janam Kundali of yourself. Besides textual content (that will help you understand what strong or weak traits you have), the Janam Kundali will also help you with charts that will showcase the position of the different planets in houses based on your current astrological situation, which reveals a whole new dimension of information. The free Janam Kundali you get on ChatMyAstrologer, though, is made after a precise study of all the scientific methods but when it comes to writing it down, the study is portrayed in a very simple language so you can understand it without any hassle. However, just in case you hit a snag or can’t understand what it means, simply chat or ring our astrologers to help you with your queries. Besides getting a Janam Kundali for yourself, we also offer Janam Kundali matching service to anyone seeking. Janam kundali matching is most important when one plans to get married. Matching of kundalis is done to ensure the girl and boy planning to get married are compatible with each other. This, however, doesn’t mean that if kundali doesn't match one shouldn’t marry the other person. But in case kundali doesn't match, an astrologer can let you know why it did not, and also recommend remedies for the same. Janam Kundali matching is related to Gun matching. Janam Kundali of two people, when matched, shows how many guns of those people match. Based on this, marriages are fixed. With Janam Kundali matching, you can also understand how being Manglik of two people will affect each other, what could be the effect of Manglik dosh on you, and remedies to get rid of Manglik dosha. These were just a handful of times when Janam Kundali could come in handy. So if looking to get one for yourself, get in touch with our astrologers for the best advice and service. To get your online Janam Kundali, Kundali prediction, and kundali reading, you can either chat with our astrologer or talk to our astrologer. For free online Kundali making, you can also visit the free Janam Kundali chart option and get a personalised free Janam kundali for yourself by our Janam Kundali maker software. You can get free kundali check and free Kundali prediction.",
  "kundli_content_1": "The Kundali of a person is one of the most sought aspects of astrology. A Kundali entails the details about the positions of stars and planets at the time of your birth based on which further predictions are made. And with further predictions, we mean predictions about different aspects of one's life like love, career, health, business, finance, and even marriage. Simply said, Kundali making is a necessary thing for any individual and is likely to improve their decision-making capabilities gradually in the course of time. A Janam Kundali is made after studying the exact position of planets at the time you were born and based on the same, one’s Sun sign, Moon sign, and other such astrological aspects are listed. The Kundali is a co-existence of predictions and charts that help the astrologer learn about what your future would be like, the times you will have to grind harder, and also the times when luck will be by your side in abundance. However, with the culture shift, people are getting very tech-savvy and seek things under their thumb. And for the same reason, the Janam Kundali making process has also gone online, making it more pocket-friendly, accessible, and detailed. We at ChatMyAstrologer, for the convenience of the huge user base of ours, provide them with free Janam kundali online so anyone and everyone has the luxury of learning more about themselves and thus can plan their life better. However, we also often bump into people who wonder if this online kundali astrology is accurate and if it has the same essence of the physical Kundali making process? Or is getting a Kundali made by a pandit or Vedic astrologer still the best option? To be honest, a Kundali made by a Vedic astrologer surely takes the top spot (which our astrologers can make for you), but an online Kundali software is no less when it comes to precision. Honestly, an online Kundali can be more detailed when compared to the physical ones. To state the obvious, just like a physical Kundali is made by learned Vedic astrologers and pandits, similarly, an online Kundali too is also prepared as per the astrological predictions by the astrologers. What changes is only the medium of sharing that information with you, i.e. digital? The digitalisation of Kundali is to only allow you more benefits like the availability of information in multiple languages.",

Daily panchang is one of the most sought Vedic astrology concepts, which conceptualise the day's planetary position to determine auspicious tithis, timing, festivals, vrats, etc. Using this information, a person can choose whether or not to begin or accomplish a particular task after carefully studying the favourability or unfavorability of the planets ruling the particular task. It is a belief among people that doing a thing or two as per Today's panchang timings brings good luck and helps in the accomplishment of the tasks with ease.",
    "At ChatMyAstrologer, a Panchang calendar is produced by a team of the best astrologers of India. The Daily Panchang details the various astrological elements of the day and based on the same, the level of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness is decided. Right from Today's sunrise time to today's sunset time, Panchang helps you find all of it as per your convenience.",
    "Majorly, Panchang is used to get detail of five aspects. These five aspects are - day of the week (vaar); tithi or the lunar day; nakshatra or the constellation; yoga; and karan. With the change in time and date, all of these compartments that make the panchang also change. And thus it’s necessary to keep oneself updated about them for various reasons."

    "All in all, there are as many as 30 tithis in a lunar month. When considering Tithis, they either belong to Shukl Paksha or Krishna paksha. In astrology, the beginning and end of a Tithi depends upon the degree of the Moon from that of the Sun. Hence a tithi can start or end at any time of the day. There are several rituals associated with Tithis. Most of the festivals fall on the new moon day (Amavasya) or the full moon day (Poornima)."
