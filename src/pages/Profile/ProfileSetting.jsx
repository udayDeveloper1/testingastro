These people sport a calm posture, and hence you feel very safe and content around them. However, some people misunderstand their calmness for them being cold and egoistic, which is rarely the case. These people have an eye for detail and have the ability to solve even the most complex problems. For some people, Virgo ascendant is really a lifeline. Also, these individuals can get very critical at times and thus don't shy away from saying the harshest truth. They believed that's how they make themselves useful to others. Virgo Ascendant people are prone to worry and hypochondria apart from being critical of self."

        `Ruled by the planet Mercury, Virgo ascendants often present an impression of laid-back bohemianism or overall strangeness. The visual aspect of Virgo, notably the face, is usually characterized as "small" and "thin." Their deliberate gait, symmetrical physique, and young, na√Øve looks are all evident. They have a fine forehead, a clear nose, and big cheeks and make slow, deliberate steps while moving. Virgos are often appealing and of medium height. Their personality is appealing to people, and their facial characteristics are appealing. Virgo rising individuals possess eyes that are usually alluring and have profundity.`

        "The Virgo ascendant is very much prone to mood swings. Though they don't react and show it off, such encounters usually change the way they react to their surroundings. Apart from this, problems near the stomach chakra and problems related to constipation are common for people born under the rising sign of Virgo. These health issues can hamper the function of sexual organs and even your intimacy if not taken care of. Thus you must be careful about your diet. Lessen the dependency on fast food to be in good shape for a long period of time."

        "They enjoy taking something and improving it. These people, who are always the critics, do great in any profession that allows them to offer their opinion, counsel, and aid. Although their dedication to precision and intolerance with carelessness might drive their coworkers crazy, they are certain to execute a good job. They work well on their own if not overseeing. It enables them to be as picky as they want to be to fulfill their own feeling of accomplishment in their job without being burdened by others. Remember, however, the fact that they must take things and improve them qualifies them to assist others. It comes naturally to them to counsel someone who is attempting to reach a goal in any pursuit. Whether it's assisting someone in losing weight, starting a business, or working on a creative project, they always provide honest counsel and practical assistance."

These people not only take their time to fall in love but also look out for something long-term. Usually, flings don't excite the natives of the Virgo rising sign. Conservative by nature and cautious with their hearts to a certain point, they benefit from a more flirtatious aggressive partner to start things off. They appreciate a direct and gentle lover and give preference to honesty and openness. Also, Virgos appreciate you being reasonable even if it means you are breaking their heart. All in all, they want you to appreciate their love, and if you can do so, they go miles for you."
