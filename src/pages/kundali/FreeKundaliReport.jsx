        `Ruled by the planet Mercury, Virgo ascendants often present an impression of laid-back bohemianism or overall strangeness. The visual aspect of Virgo, notably the face, is usually characterized as "small" and "thin." Their deliberate gait, symmetrical physique, and young, na√Øve looks are all evident. They have a fine forehead, a clear nose, and big cheeks and make slow, deliberate steps while moving. Virgos are often appealing and of medium height. Their personality is appealing to people, and their facial characteristics are appealing. Virgo rising individuals possess eyes that are usually alluring and have profundity.`,

Apart from this, problems near the stomach chakra and problems related to constipation are common for people born under the rising sign of Virgo. These health issues can hamper the function of sexual organs and even your intimacy if not taken care of. Thus you must be careful about your diet. Lessen the dependency on fast food to be in good shape for a long period of time.",

Although their dedication to precision and intolerance with carelessness might drive their coworkers crazy, they are certain to execute a good job. They work well on their own if not overseeing. It enables them to be as picky as they want to be to fulfill their own feeling of accomplishment in their job without being burdened by others. Remember, however, the fact that they must take things and improve them qualifies them to assist others. It comes naturally to them to counsel someone who is attempting to reach a goal in any pursuit. Whether it's assisting someone in losing weight, starting a business, or working on a creative project, they always provide honest counsel and practical assistance.",

Conservative by nature and cautious with their hearts to a certain point, they benefit from a more flirtatious aggressive partner to start things off. They appreciate a direct and gentle lover and give preference to honesty and openness. Also, Virgos appreciate you being reasonable even if it means you are breaking their heart. All in all, they want you to appreciate their love, and if you can do so, they go miles for you.",
